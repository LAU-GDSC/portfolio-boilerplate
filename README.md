# portfolio-boilerplate

## Purpose
This repo serves as boilerplate code to the GDSC LAU series of portfolio building workshops.
It provides the basic structure and files needed to create a portfolio website.

## Getting Started

To get started with your portfolio, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Populate the Files**: The repository contains three main files:
   - `index.html`: This is the main HTML file for your portfolio. Update it with your information, projects, and content.
   - `styles.css`: This CSS file is used for styling your portfolio. Customize the styles to match your design preferences.
   - `script.js`: If you want to add interactive features or functionality to your portfolio, you can do so in this JavaScript file.

3. **Customization**: Feel free to customize these files further to meet your specific needs. You can modify the HTML structure, apply your own styling, and add interactivity using JavaScript.

4. **Deployment**: When you're ready, deploy your portfolio to a web hosting service or platform of your choice.

5. **Update the README**: Modify this README to include personal information you would like your viewers to know.
